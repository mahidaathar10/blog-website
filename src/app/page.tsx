      <p>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, music, videos, and more, by learning patterns from existing data. These models leverage advanced techniques like deep learning and neural networks to produce creative outputs.

        Over time, Generative AI has advanced significantly, leading to the development of innovative tools and applications across various domains.

        So far, tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, MidJourney, GitHub Copilot, and NVIDIAâ€™s AI technologies have revolutionized industries such as content creation, design, coding, and gaming.</p>
